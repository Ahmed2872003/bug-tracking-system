• Introduction

    • purpose
        
        The purpose of this system (defect tracking application) is to efficiently track software bugs
        observed by customers who use the system.

    • Scope 

        The scope of the bug tracking system is software that helps customers to have the solution for 
        bugs of the system's created projects. Also, it will help developers (staff) to know bug details to solve it. So the 
        system is a relationship between customers with their bugs and the staff who will solve those bugs. Under 
        control the admin who manages which bugs are assigned to whom from the staff, determines both functional and 
        non-functional requirements of the bug tracking system. Also, the document provides an overall description 
        Of the bug-tracking system with UML analysis models.
